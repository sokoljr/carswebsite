                                    <p>The Mercedes-Benz A-Class is a compact car (subcompact in its first two generations) produced by the German automobile manufacturer Mercedes-Benz. The first generation (W168) was introduced in 1997, the second generation model (W169) appeared in late 2004, and the third generation model (W176) was launched in 2012.</p>
                                    <p>Originally launched only as a five-door hatchback in 1997, the second generation W169 introduced a three-door hatchback. In the markets that the A-Class is or has been sold in, it has represented the entry level model of Mercedes-Benz. Having grown by 68 cm (27 in) since the original model, the 2012 A-class is now longer than the first-generation B-class.</p>

                                <h3>B-Class – Multi Purpose Vehicle (MPV)</h3>

                                    <img class="img-responsive cars_box_page" src="img/cars_B_class.jpg" alt="cars">
                                    <p>The Mercedes-Benz B-Class is a compact luxury car produced by German automaker Mercedes-Benz since 2005. Mercedes-Benz markets it as a sports compact tourer. It is similar to the A-Class, though bigger and with bigger engines. The European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) classifies it as a small MPV (multi-purpose vehicle). As of December 20, 2013, delivery of B-Class vehicles reached 1 million since the launch of the B-Class in 2005.</p>
                                    <p>The second generation B-Class was introduced at the 2011 International Motor Show Germany. European models went on sale in November 2011. Japan models went on sale in April 2012. They assembled at Rastatt, Germany, and from 2011 at Kecskemet, Hungary. By summer 2013, over 230,000 second generation B-Class cars had been delivered.</p>
                                    <p>It included new gasoline and diesel engines, mated to either a six-speed manual or seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. Drag coefficient was lowered, despite growing in overall dimensions to the benefit of interior space. A new four-cylinder engine was introduced with the model, the M270.
                                    New safety systems included adaptive cruise control, blind spot assist and, a collision prevention adaptive brake system.</p>

                                <h3>C-Class – Saloon, Estate, Coupé and Cabriolet</h3>

                                    <p>The Mercedes-Benz C-Class is a line of compact executive cars produced by Daimler AG. Introduced in 1993 as a replacement for the 190 (W201) range, the C-Class was the smallest model in the marque's lineup until the A-Class arrived in 1997. The C-Class is built at Mercedes-Benz factories in Sindelfingen and Bremen, Germany as well as numerous satellite factories in other countries. The first C-Class (W202) sedan was produced on 1 June 1993, and the first of the second generation (W203) rolled off the assembly line on 18 July 2000. The C-Class has been available with a 4Matic (i.e. four-wheel drive) option since 2002. The third generation (W204) was launched in 2007. The latest generation C-Class (W205) came out in 2014.</p>
                                    <p>Though originally available as a sedan and a station wagon, the W203 series in 2000 debuted a fastback coupé (SportCoupé) version that, when facelifted, became the Mercedes-Benz CLC-Class. The CLC-Class remained in production until 2011 when it was replaced by a new W204 C-Class coupé for the 2012 model year.</p>

                                    <p>The Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class is a compact executive car developed and manufactured by Mercedes-Benz, based on the platform of the Mercedes-Benz W176 A-Class and W246 B-Class compact cars, formally launched at the January 2013 North American International Auto Show.

                                    <p>The CLA first went on sale in Europe in April 2013, and was subsequently introduced in the United States in September 2013. Its largest markets being those of Western Europe and the United States. Global cumulative CLA sales reached 100,000 during its first year, called as "our best launch in 20 years" by Mercedes-Benz.

                                <h3>CLS-Class – 4 Door Coupé and Estate</h3>
                                <div>
                                    <img class="img-responsive cars_box_page" src="img/cars_CLS_class.jpg" alt="cars">
                                    <p>he Mercedes-Benz CLS is a four-door full-size luxury coupe originally launched in 2004 and based on the W211 E-Class and was internally designated as the W219. The second generation CLS-Class was introduced in September 2010 and production started in the beginning of 2011.</p>
                                    <p>The CLS slots above the E-Class and below the S-Class.</p>
                                    <p>The CLS marked Mercedes-Benz's return to the executive-size coupe market since the (W124) E-Class Coupe (a two-door sedan) went out of production in 1995. The (W210) E-Class did not spawn a coupe variant, as Mercedes-Benz chose instead to introduce a smaller coupe based on the compact C-Class, the CLK-Class. However, the CLK-Class was built with a lengthened C-Class wheelbase so it could be slotted as a mid-sized vehicle, and it also featured styling cues, engines, and similar pricing to the (W210) E-Class to give the impression that the (W124) E-Class Coupe had been directly replaced.</p>
                                    <p>Marketed as a four-door coupe, the CLS was designed by the American automotive designer, Michael Fink in 2001 (born 1967), who styled the first CLK, the C-Sportcoupe, and is known as the stylist who penned the Maybach 57 and 62. According to a Mercedes-Benz press release, the CLS-class was produced to combine the "strong, emotive charisma" of a coupe with the "comfort and practicality" of a sedan. Save for its four-door design, the CLS's design tends towards a coupe, as its sleek roofline reduces the rear passenger room to a 2+2 arrangement, and it offers a smaller selection of engines tending towards high powered of the range, compared to contemporary sedans such as the E-Class.</p>
                                </div>
                                <h3>E-Class – Saloon, Estate, Coupé and Cabriolet</h3>
                                <div>
                                    <img class="img-responsive cars_box_page" src="img/cars_E_class.jpg" alt="cars">
                                    <p>The Mercedes-Benz E-Class is a range of executive cars manufactured by German automaker Mercedes-Benz in various engine and body configurations produced since 1993, marketed worldwide across five generations.
                                    Prior to 1993, Mercedes-Benz offered the same category of car under a non-unified naming structure. The E initially stood for Einspritzmotor (German for fuel injection engine); a new feature in volume production vehicles at the time that the E-Class first appeared, with the E as a suffix to the engine nomenclature (e.g. 230 E) in the 1960s. It was not until the launch of the facelifted W124 in 1993 that the E was used as a prefix (i.e., E 220) and the model referred to officially as the E-Class (or E-Klasse). At this time all Mercedes cars used fuel injection and the company felt it was no longer necessary to add this as a distinguishing feature.</p>
                                    <p>Historically, the E-Class Saloons and Estates is Mercedes-Benz' best-selling model with more than 13 million sold by 2015. Though originally available as 4-door sedan and 5-door station wagon, the W212 series in 2009 debuted a 2-door coupé and 2-door convertible. Before that, the Mercedes-Benz CLK-Class' (1997-2009) design and styling was derived from the E-Class although technically it was based on the mechanical underpinnings of the smaller C-Class. Due to the E-Class's size and durability, it have filled many market segments, frequently serve as taxis in European and Asian countries, and special-purpose vehicles (e.g., police or ambulance modifications) from the factory.</p>

                                <h3>G-Class – Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV)</h3>
                                <div>
                                    <img class="img-responsive cars_box_page" src="img/cars_G_class.jpg" alt="cars">
                                    <p>The Mercedes-Benz G-Class, sometimes called G-Wagen (short for Geländewagen, "cross country vehicle"), is a mid-size four-wheel drive luxury SUV manufactured by Magna Steyr (formerly Steyr-Daimler-Puch) in Austria and sold by Mercedes-Benz. In certain markets, it has been sold under the Puch name as Puch G. The G-wagen is characterized by its boxy styling and body-on-frame construction. It uses three fully locking differentials, one of the few vehicles to have such a feature. Despite the introduction of an intended replacement, the unibody SUV Mercedes-Benz GL-Class in 2006, the G-Class is still in production and is one of the longest produced Mercedes-Benz in Daimler's history, with a span of 35 years. Only the Unimog surpasses it.</p>
                                    <p>The G-class was developed as a military vehicle from a suggestion by the Shah of Iran (at the time a significant Mercedes shareholder) to Mercedes and offered as a civilian version in 1979. In this role it is sometimes referred to as the "Wolf" and LAPV Enok. The Peugeot P4 is a variant made under license, with a Peugeot engine and different parts.
                                    It was not available from Mercedes-Benz in the United States until 2002, although this was preceded by a grey-market where even basic models commanded six-figure prices in the 1990s. It was launched in 2002 as the Mercedes-Benz G500 with a V-8 gas engine and achieved 3114 sales that year. This eventually tapered down to some sub-1000 sales years, however, in the 2010s sales began to increase again surpassing 3000 in 2014 and in 2015 it sold more than in its launch year, with 3616 sold that year. So called "off-road" vehicles have been heavily mocked for their widespread on-road only use in the USA (and related 4x4 SUV's like the G-Class), however it is indeed deteriorted on-road conditions that can be a matter of life-and-death transportation need, or at least getting to work for many drivers due to inclement weather, such as snow or flooded roads.</p>

                                <h3>GLA-Class – Compact Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV)/ Crossover</h3>
                                <div>

                                    <p>The Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class is a luxury compact crossover automobile unveiled by the German manufacturer Mercedes-Benz at the 2013 Frankfurt Auto Show. It was previously unveiled to the public at the Shanghai Auto Show in April 2013 as a concept car.
                                    The name GLA was devised in accordance with the revised Mercedes-Benz nomenclature for SUVs. This was formally announced in November 2014 to begin rollout in 2015. However, the GLA-Class name was already compliant with the naming structure since its debut. Under this scheme, SUVs use the base name "GL", followed by the model's placement in Mercedes-Benz hierarchy. The "G" is for geländewagen (German for off-road vehicle) and alludes the long-running G-Wagen. This is followed by the letter "L" that acts as a linkage with the letter "A"—the GLA being the SUV equivalent to the A-Class.
                                    Designed to compete with the BMW X1 and Audi Q3, It slots below the Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class, renamed GLC-Class from 2015.</p>
                                    <p>The GLA-Class is powered by a range of petrol and diesel 4-cylinder engines, and comes in either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive 4Matic.</p>

                                    <p>Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class is a compact luxury SUV introduced in 2015 for the 2016 model year that replaces the former Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class.
                                    Under the vehicle naming scheme maintained by Mercedes-Benz, SUV's use the base name "GL", followed by the model's placement in Mercedes-Benz hierarchy. The "G" is for Geländewagen (German for off-road vehicle) and alludes the long-running G-Wagen. This is followed by the letter "L" that acts as a linkage with the letter "C"—the GLC being the SUV equivalent to the C-Class.</p>
                                    <p>The GLC, like its predecessor, is currently assembled at Mercedes-Benz' plant in Bremen, Germany. Since the main GLC production site in Bremen already runs at full capacity, Mercedes-Benz have decided to expand the production capacity by utilizing Valmet Automotive plant at Uusikaupunki, Finland. The manufacturing of the GLC will start in Finland during Q1/2017.</p>
                                    <p>The GLC-Class is available only in a five-door hatchback bodystyle with seating for five. Mercedes also plans a GLC Coupe, with four doors and a V6.</p>
                                    <p>Power comes from a choice of 2-liter 4-cylinder turbocharged petrol (same engine combined with the electric engine in the 350e hybrid) and 2.2-liter 4-cylinder turbo diesel engines in various power stages mated to a 9-speed (7 speed for the 350e hybrid) G-Tronic automatic transmission. 4MATIC all-wheel-drive is standard in some markets and optional in others. The GLC is 183.3 in (4,656 mm) long, 74.4 in (1,890 mm) wide and 64.5 in (1,638 mm) tall, with a track of 63.9 in (1,623 mm) in front and 63.7 in (1,618 mm) in the rear.

                                    <img class="img-responsive cars_box_page" src="img/cars_GLE_class.jpg" alt="cars">
                                    <p>The Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class is a sport utility vehicle (SUV) built by the German car manufacturer Mercedes-Benz. The GLE-Class name will be used in 2015 for the forthcoming facelifted Mercedes-Benz M-Class (W166) and the new five-door coupé derivative GLE-Class Coupe (C292) which was unveiled to the public in January 2015 at the North American International Auto Show. As part of Mercedes-Benz's new naming strategy, the GLE-Class will define the SUV's positioning in the middle of its segment and between the future GLC and GLS-Classes (the former GLK and GL, respectively), the same way the E-Class is positioned in relation to the C and S-Classes</p>

                                <h3>GLS-Class – Large Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV)</h3>
                                <div>
                                    <img class="img-responsive cars_box_page" src="img/cars_GLS_class.jpg" alt="cars">
                                    <p>The Mercedes-Benz GL-Class is a full-size luxury SUV produced by the German carmaker Mercedes-Benz since 2006. It is a three-row, seven-passenger vehicle positioned above the M-Class/GLE-Class in the lineup and is the flagship of the Mercedes-Benz SUV line. The GL shares the same unibody architecture with the M-Class. The vast majority of GL-Class vehicles are assembled at Mercedes-Benz US International, Inc, in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama except for a small number of early production 2007 model vehicles which were manufactured in Germany. The first generation (X164) was manufactured between 2006 and 2012 and was replaced in 2012 by the new generation GL-Class (X166).</p>
                                    <p>From 2015, with the release of the facelifted X166 second generation model, the GL-Class was renamed as Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class as per the revised nomenclature adopted by the brand. Under this scheme, SUVs use the base name "GL", followed by the model's placement in Mercedes-Benz hierarchy. The "G" is for geländewagen (German for off-road vehicle) and alludes the long-running G-Wagen. This is followed by the letter "L" that acts as a linkage with the letter "S"—the GLS being the SUV equivalent to the S-Class.</p>

                                <h3>S-Class – Luxury Saloon, Coupé & Cabriolet</h3>
                                <div>
                                    <img class="img-responsive cars_box_page" src="img/cars_S_class.jpg" alt="cars">
                                    <p>The Mercedes-Benz S-Class, formerly known as Sonderklasse (German for "special class"), is a series of flagship vehicles produced by the German automaker Mercedes-Benz, a division of German company Daimler AG. The classification was officially introduced in 1972 with the W116 S-Class, which succeeded previous Mercedes-Benz models dating to the mid-1950s. The S-Class has served as the top model for Mercedes for over fifty years in its various incarnations. The S-Class has debuted many of the company's latest innovations, including drivetrain technologies, interior features, and safety systems (such as the first seatbelt pretensioners). The S-Class has ranked as the world's best-selling luxury sedan, and its latest generation, the W222 S-Class, premiered in 2013. As in previous iterations, the W221 S-Class is sold in standard- and long-wheelbase versions; I4, V6, V8, V12, diesel and hybrid powertrains are offered. All models built in Mexico or sold in the United States are only available in long wheelbase.</p>
                                    <p>"S-Class" is the anglicized version of "S-Klasse," an abbreviation of the previously mentioned Sonderklasse. In automotive terms it refers to "a specially outfitted car." Although used colloquially for decades, following its official application in 1972, six generations of officially named S-Klasse sedans have been produced. Previous two-door coupe models of the S-Class were known as SEC and later S-Coupe. In 1998 the S-Class coupe was spun off in a separate line as the CL-Class, however as of June 2014, it has been re-designated as the S-Class Coupé for the 2015 model year, doing away with the CL-Class.</p>

                                <h3>SL-Class – Grand Tourer</h3>
                                <div>
                                    <img class="img-responsive cars_box_page" src="img/cars_SL_class.jpg" alt="cars">
                                    <p>The Mercedes-Benz SL-Class (formerly known as the SL Roadster prior to 1994) is a grand touring roadster manufactured by Mercedes since 1954. The designation SL derives from the German Sportlich-Leicht, (English: Sport Lightweight). The original idea was suggested by American importer Max Hoffman, who perceived a market for a toned-down Gran Prix car tailored to affluent performance enthusiasts in the booming post-war American market, which remains the primary market for the vehicles.</p>
                                    <p>The SL designation was first applied to the 300 SL, often referred to as the "Gullwing" due to its gullwing or upward-opening doors.</p>
                                    <p>The term SL refers to the marketing variations of the vehicle, including the numerous engine configurations spanning six design generations.</p>

                                <h3>SLS-Class – Roadster</h3>
                                <div>
                                    <img class="img-responsive cars_box_page" src="img/cars_SLS_class.jpg" alt="cars">
                                    <p>The Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class is a compact luxury roadster manufactured by Daimler-Benz in three generations; R170 launched in 1996, the R171 in 2004 and R172 in 2011.
                                    Mercedes presented the SLK II concept car at the 1994 Paris Motor Show, showing off the "vario-roof". The car went on sale two years later in Europe, and in 1997 in the US. The SLK is built in Bremen, Germany.</p>
                                    <p>The designation "SLK" derives from the company's design mission to create a roadster that was at once sporty, light and short—in German: sportlich (sporty), leicht (light) und kurz (short).</p>
                                    <p>For the 2017 model year (late 2016), with the release of the third generation R172 facelift, the SLK-Class will be renamed to Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class in accordance with the revised nomenclature adopted by the brand. Under this scheme, roadsters use the base name "SL", followed by the model's placement in Mercedes-Benz hierarchy. The "SL" is for Sportlich Leicht (German for "Sport Light") and alludes to the long-running SL-Class. This is followed by the letter "C"—the SLC being the roadster equivalent to the C-Class.</p>

                                    <p>The Mercedes-Benz Vito is a light van produced by Mercedes-Benz. It is available as a standard panel van for cargo (called Vito), or with passenger accommodations substituted for part or all of the load area (called V-Class or Viano).</p>
                                    <p>The V-Class/Viano is a multi-purpose vehicle. The first generation went on sale in 1996. The second generation was introduced in 2004, and the vehicle received the new Viano name. In 2010, the vehicle was facelifted with revised front and rear bumpers and lights. The interior was also improved with upgraded materials and new technology. The third generation was launched in 2014 and returned to being called V-Class.</p>
                                    <p>The Viano is available in both rear- and four-wheel-drive configurations and comes in three lengths, two wheelbases and a choice of four petrol and diesel engines (as well as two specialist tuned models) coupled to either a six-speed manual or five-speed TouchShift automatic transmission.</p>

                                    <img class="img-responsive cars_box_page" src="img/cars_AMG_class.jpg" alt="cars">
                                    <p>The Mercedes-AMG GT (C190) is a 2-door, 2-seat grand tourer coupé produced by Mercedes-AMG. The sports car was presented on September 9, 2014 and was officially unveiled to the public in October 2014 at the Paris Motor Show.After the SLS AMG, it is the second sports car developed entirely in-house by Mercedes-AMG. The car is produced in two performance variations, with the Mercedes-AMG GT S (C120) having a slightly higher performance. Both models went on sale in March 2015, with a GT3 racing variant of the car expected to be released in 2016. All variants are assembled at the Mercedes-Benz plant in Sindelfingen, Germany.The interior of the Mercedes-AMG GT was previewed on April 16, 2014. The car made its debut on September 9, 2014 and was officially unveiled to the public in October 2014 at the Paris Motor Show with two performance options: the GT, with 340 kW (462 PS; 456 bhp), and the GT S with 375 kW (510 PS; 503 bhp). The GT has 600 N·m (443 lb·ft) of torque, and the GT S has 650 N·m (479 lb·ft) of torque.</p>
                                    <p>The Mercedes-AMG GT S is Formula 1's current safety car, having made its debut in that role at the 2015 Australian Grand Prix.</p>
                                    <p>Shortly after its release, Mercedes-AMG CEO Tobias Moers promised a Black Series variant of the Mercedes-AMG GT. Mercedes-Benz has confirmed that the new Mercedes-AMG GT S will cost starting at $129,900. The AMG GT's exterior design was kept similar to that of the preceding SLS AMG. It features the wide wheel arches and lower bodywork of the SLS, but does not employ its gullwing doors. The large hood and slim windscreen have also stayed the same. The exterior lead designer was Mark Fetherston, whose previous works include the W176 A-Class, the CLA-Class and the SLS. The interior, designed by Jan Kaul, features a large center console and decorative elements in a leather and carbon polymer design. The trunk offers room for a medium-sized suitcase.</p>
                                    <p>The vehicle structure is made up of 93% aluminum, with the front module base made up of magnesium.</p>
